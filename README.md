# Jersey’s Global Opportunity 

## 1	Introduction
At Digital Jersey’s annual review, it was encouraging to hear from world renowned Identity and Blockchain expert and author Dave Birch that Jersey has a unique opportunity to capitalise on leveraging blockchain technologies. 

It would be the missed opportunity of a generation if Jersey does not fully get to grips with some of the options available and take advantage of them to become a leader instead of a follower. 
Jersey has the prospect to provide a platform for Digital Identity, Know Your Client (KYC) and Client Due Diligence (CDD) that not only makes it easier for individuals to do business with Jersey-based financial services companies, but also provides a benefit to those users in a local and global context. 

It is entirely possible for the approach proposed in this paper to result in there being NO cost to the tax payer. 

It would clearly be advantageous if the government and/or regulator were paid for any activities that incur effort or cost, and have re-usable value, than the tax payer footing the bill for activities concerning predominantly off-island residents. 

This may sound unrealistic but it is entirely possible and would clearly be desirable from a tax-payer’s perspective, especially given the need for Jersey to balance its books  and an eGov spend of over £9M  which included a Digital ID project for Jersey citizens (unlikely to be accepted by the regulator and financial services organisations for numerous reasons; architecture of the platform, all customer data being stored centrally and off island, lack of core ID features such as selective disclosure using zero knowledge proofs).

Jersey has a real opportunity to be a leader in this space, and positively affect the financial services industry, rather than a follower.

It is incumbent on all of us (government, regulator, industry, citizens) to evaluate options that are for the greater good of our island; if the proposed solution is adopted, there would be additional benefits including further diversification or our economy; export of the Intellectual Property (IP) from an identity and technology perspective, ability to fill some of the dramatically increasing demand for specialist skills. 

This paper outlines the current challenges, the government’s proposed solution, followed by the strongly recommended approach for implementing a platform and ecosystem at no cost to the tax payer, that also provides benefits to all participants. 

## 2	Identity, KYC and CDD
As a well-regarded financial services hub, Jersey has an enviable position as a trusted financial services jurisdiction.  

The ever-increasing regulatory burden is one of the reasons for this. Ensuring that our laws and regulations are appropriate for delivering financial services to global citizens; an estimated 2 million customers benefit from Jersey’s financial services. There is some evidence that there is duplication, so a conservative estimate would indicate that there are at least 1 million individuals that are customers of Jersey-based financial institutions.

It is critical to ensure identification of these customers accurately and efficiently. 

However, there is currently no mechanism to have one’s identity verified to any suitable level online, let alone allow that identity to be re-used. 

A scenario that is all-too-common exists whereby customers (including valuable high net worth individuals) are having to provide physical documents or certified copies of those documents on a regular basis to multiple service providers. The effort that is required by both individual and service provider is excessive, and arguably doesn’t even provide the supposed fraud protection that it is intended to; there are few experts in document forgery, and it has been proven that technology can better match people with their identity document photos than humans . 

In a global marketplace this is undoubtedly an area that collaboration amongst the government, the regulator and industry can dramatically improve to make it more appealing to do business. 

The government and/or regulator can provide significant value in verifying (or certifying/signing) an individual’s identity to a suitable level such that it can be re-used efficiently. 

## 3	Financial Services Passport 
At a recent session held by the States of Jersey where a number of local technology suppliers and industry service providers were in attendance, as well as the Jersey Financial Services Commission, a high-level timeline and plan for implementing a solution for a “financial services passport” was presented. 

The project overview is as follows: 
Make Jersey more attractive to financial services business by enhancing the interaction for the customer. Utilise intelligent technology to ensure underlying customers are not responding to ID verification requests from multiple institutions
Evolve the concept that Jersey should aim to be the “easiest jurisdiction for a customer to conduct international financial services business”
The documented expected benefits include: 
•	Cost reduction
•	Reduced compliance effort
•	Safe harbour
•	Speed of obtaining evidence
•	Single point of contact (reduced duplication)
•	Convenience for customers
•	Enhance quality
•	Jurisdictional reputation

The proposed solution essentially consists of a centralised database and service for storing results of identity verification and CDD/KYC checks. Service providers would be able to use this data and trust that the verification had been undertaken to a sufficient standard, also affecting the liability of the provider. 
This approach is not particularly innovative, and has a number of risks associated with it, not least the target of high net worth individuals’ data. 
One only has to look at Equifax  and other notorious leaks to recognise that this is a high risk. It is also a comparatively expensive solution, given the amount of security that is required to mitigate the risks of attack. 

It is often said that “there are only two types of organisations; those who have been hacked and those who will be hacked”. 

This quote was first attributed to FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III, however these days it is more likely that the two types of organisations are “those that know they have been hacked, and those that don’t”.
There are numerous other risks and issues with this approach including; 
•	Cost
o	Implementation and on-going running costs, who is going to pay for it and what would the ROI be?
o	Cost reduction is listed as that first expected benefit… this surely cannot be achieved by comparison with the proposed approach
•	Service provision (who will be trusted to run it?) 
•	Re-usability
o	Users would not be able to re-use their verified credentials outside of the narrow local context
o	Convenience for customers will be affected
•	Scalability 
•	Lack of competitiveness
o	Providing a dated solution using legacy technologies will not give Jersey a cost-effective or globally competitive solution – followers vs leaders.
•	Suitability 
o	The number of data points that are proposed to be captured as part of the proposed scheme are just a fraction of those required by most banks. For higher risk clients, the customer identification element is just a small part of the overall enhanced due diligence process. The cost of implementing just a small part of the solution would likely not make a big enough impact for banks to warrant the expense. 

## 4	Banking Suitability 
The JFSC Banking Business Licensing Policy  states: 
Applicants should be part of financial institutions of international stature and reputation. It is the Commission’s policy that registrations under the Banking Law are limited to entities which are, or which are ultimately owned by, members of the global “Top 1,000” banking groups by reference to their Tier 1 capital base, or financial services conglomerates of equivalent size.

This means that organisations with a Jersey banking licence are all part of a parent off-island organisation. All banks have their own policies on risk and KYC/CDD. These policies always require more information to be captured than the comparatively basic regulations, often dictated by a group bank with global standards. 

As a result, ID verification is only part of the process for banks, and far from a complete solution. 

However, by employing the proposed approach, integration could be facilitated at zero cost to banks and still provide a useful starting point to continue KYC/CDD to their own standards. There would also be opportunity for a bank to monetise this effort by allowing the customer to re-use the information captured by the Jersey bank in another context. For example, organisations in another jurisdiction that face similar challenges would be likely welcome being able to reduce risk of high net worth individuals by verifying the data already collected as part of enhanced due diligence in Jersey, and willing to pay for this. 

## 5	Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) Suitability
Numerous organisations that do not provide traditional financial services are still subject to Jersey’s Money Laundering legislation .

Proceeding with a relatively basic identity verification approach for these organisations including lawyers, estate agents and others would still have value. 

The current standard practice is typically for these organisations to photocopy a passport or driving licence and other documents, no matter how recently other copies had been taken, exposing all organisations to unnecessary risk of falling foul of the forthcoming (GDPR-adequate) data protection legislation . 

By proceeding with the proposed approach, this risk would be eliminated. Users would have the right to revoke access to the data captured, validated, and presented to these organisations, provided the record-keeping periods outlined in the relevant money laundering order were complied with (sections 19 & 20) .

## 6	Decentralized Systems & Blockchain Technologies
Enter decentralized systems, a new model for data governance and control, that is enabled by blockchain technologies. It is important to note that blockchain is a component of a decentralized system, and not the entire solution.

Unfortunately, due to many instances of “blockchain washing” (using the term unnecessarily and frequently incorrectly, usually for marketing purposes) the technology is frequently misunderstood and therefore ignored. 

A blockchain is, in its simplest form is an open distributed registry/database of software keys that can be kept under control of an owner. It is this ability to register and control keys that creates a new paradigm of data storage and governance. It is not that data is stored on a blockchain, it is that the blockchain enables an owner to control who has the keys to data repositories.

The significant advantages in leveraging this technology over a centralised approach include: 
•	Disaster recovery – the data is replicated in many locations 
•	Availability – numerous nodes exist so the system is never down  
•	Tamper-proof – the database is immutable 
•	Public & provable – cryptographic proof that an entry is valid (e.g. identity was verified at a particular point in time by a particular party)
•	Consensus model for decryption – in case of an investigation, it is possible to implement a solution that requires consensus (for example, regulator, police and legal representation) to unlock encrypted documents that are otherwise only available to the individual concerned – “just enough data protection and privacy”

## 7	The KYC Token
The world is awash with news of token sales or Initial Coin Offerings or ICOs .  As with the word blockchain there is a lot of ambiguity; how token sales work, what they do, and when they are appropriate.
There are three high level categories:

1.  Commodities – where the token is used to power a network
2.	Software licences – where the token is used to access or operate a system, also known as a “utility token”
3.	Securities – where a token grants the owner rights to economic output where the token has no primary use
In the case of a KYC system a token would be classified as a software licence that provides a means for a customer of the network to pay for the network to respond to a question. In the KYC case the question could be from Bank A to the network asking "Is this Bob and does Bob have a valid set of checks to pass AML requirements?”.
These tokens can be purchased on an ongoing basis and used to pay for a service, for example, verifying one’s identity, or re-using verified credentials. 

### 7.1	Token Distribution
A token sale is a means of distributing software licences to use the network. 

Given the wide distribution of potential customers of the platform, the network owners may establish a reseller model whereby resellers and organisations that may be interested in consuming services at a later date can purchase tokens that would later be redeemable. 

It is proposed that a token distribution model through resellers is used to accelerate the distribution and take up of a digital identity, KYC and CDD platform. 
This is a tried and tested approach for fund-raising; numerous examples of successful ICO’s or Token Sales for the development of blockchain platforms and services have raised sums over $100 million US dollars in the last 18 months. 

From previous similar identity-based initiatives, amounts raised vary between $21M USD (SelfKey) to $33M USD (Civic). 

It would not be unreasonable to expect that a token sale with government and regulator backing to raise enough capital to complete this project, including integration with service providers. This would be at no cost to the tax payer. 

### 7.2	Token Value and Use
In order for a token to have value and to not simply be a speculative investment or security, it is critical for the use of that token to be well-defined.

The UK Verify scheme employs a model whereby multiple identity providers are rewarded by the UK government for each identity that is verified, and then subsequently a smaller reward for each time that user authenticates. 

It is proposed that the KYC token is a “utility token”, used as a form of software license. 

The token will be used as a means to reward the organisations that have been performing the underlying activity – in this case verifying the identity of an individual, with checks carried out to a suitable level in order for them to conduct their financial services business in Jersey. Securely, safely, efficiently and compliant with all of the Money Laundering Order legislation . 

Once implemented, a customer would initially need to have their identity verified. Given the predominantly off-island jurisdictions the customer base resides in, it is reasonable to expect the vast majority of them to have passports. Passports can be scanned in using mobile phones and checked against a number of sources including comparison with a recent photo taken by the individual on their smart phone. There are numerous means of verifying the passport holder is who they say they are; the JFSC’s risk-based approach  would accommodate an approach combining a number of factors. 

It is proposed that the user’s identity attributes are then signed and verified by the regulator or other trusted party, then hashed, encrypted and stored on the blockchain. This would allow this evidence can be provided to a 3rd party that the individual has had checks carried out to a prescribed level. Enhanced due diligence levels could include a police check, world check and other common CDD / KYC activities avoiding the need for financial service providers to repeat them. However, it would only be fair for the service provider to pay a fraction of the original cost of identity verification back to the identity verifier as they will be avoiding the need to undertake this activity themselves.  

## 8	Economic Model
As already mentioned, the proposed model is designed to provide a means to fund the project, as well as reward the actors in the system that are providing value; certifying identity attributes, for example. 
This section covers the economic model or “tokenomics” in more detail. 

### 8.1	Identity Management Value
Identity management requires a lifecycle to be effective. A point-in-time verification of a user’s identity will not be sufficient. 
A number of activities are expected to be undertaken in relation to identity verification (IdV). These activities have a value that can be realised, by enabling the results to be shared with service providers. 

#### 8.1.1	Identity Attribute Verification
A relevant person may demonstrate that it has found out the identity of an individual who is a customer under Article 3(2)(a) of the Money Laundering Order where it collects all of the following: 
•	Legal name, name(s) currently used, any former legal name(s) (such as maiden name), and name(s) formerly used. 
•	Principal residential address. 
•	Date of birth. 
•	Place of birth. 
•	Nationality. 
•	Sex. 
•	Government issued personal identification number or other government issued unique identifier.
These attributes may come from a number of sources including physical ID documents; the reliability of which also varies based on the source:
•	Passport
•	National ID Card 
•	Driving Licence 
•	Utility Bills
•	Gov Correspondence
•	Bank Statement 
•	Tenancy Contract / Agreement 
It is proposed that the process of verifying the customer’s attributes be undertaken by a trusted party. By leveraging technology it would be possible for individuals meeting certain criteria to be identified without human intervention. The process would be automated for as many cases as practical, with manual approaches for edge cases. In this case the regulator or the government would need to be involved, although not necessarily by implementing the checks; a seal of approval on the approach may be sufficient. The Australian model whereby multiple trusted and audited 3rd parties are all able to provide the service would be a possible extension to the model in future. 

The government project team proposed that if the government, regulator or a trusted and audited 3rd party was conducting the checks, liability would also be affected. This would negate the need to repeat certain checks internally, and result in a reduced regulatory burden on financial services organisations in Jersey. 

#### 8.1.2	Attestation
In order for risk to be reduced over a period, identity attribute attestation (on-going review of identity attributes) will also be required. 
The service provider may also request attributes to be re-verified; attributes may also expire. 

The effort in re-verifying attributes is expected to be less than the effort to verify an individual’s identity in the first instance. 

The re-verified attributes can also be shared with service providers that the user has engaged with and previously consented to provide details to. 

#### 8.1.3	Enhanced Verification
For compliance with the associated regulations, a number of identity attributes are required to be verified. 

However, various scenarios may require enhanced due diligence. Certain additional checks such as a police / criminal records check, a disclosure Scotland  or World Check .  
These checks can have a cost associated with them; typically the service provider will incur that cost. 

The identity verification provider (in this case the government, regulator or trusted 3rd party) would have an opportunity to sign documents and/or complete processes to ensure that an individual has had these enhanced verification checks completed, recouping the costs from the individual or service provider. 

### 8.2	Service Revenue Model
The identity verification activity should be rewarded by the consumer of that data, as it will be saving them time and effort. 

In lieu of undertaking the same checks on that customer, it is expected that financial services providers would contribute to those costs by using tokens.

Other service providers (e.g. legal, utilities, estate agents etc.) would also be able to benefit from the checks having been carried out by a trusted party.

The cost of the verification may be set by the organisation that is providing the verification, and paid by the service consumer. 

There would be opportunity for verification service providers to recoup costs every time a service is used (per authentication event). However, a simple model would be for the service providers to recoup the cost of the initial identity verification and on-going attestation where appropriate. 

## 9	Summary
There is a strong desire to improve the situation for all parties, as evidenced by the government’s work to date.

In order for Jersey to lead the way and provide a useful mechanism for its financial services customers to interact with service providers in Jersey and beyond, it is necessary to re-think the approach for identity verification and attestation. 

It would be the missed opportunity of a generation if we don’t all work towards a future where risk is reduced, where customer on-boarding and on-going KYC/CDD is easier for all parties. 

It would also be an unfortunate waste of tax-payer’s money to proceed with an approach that was funded using a traditional model, where alternatives exist.
